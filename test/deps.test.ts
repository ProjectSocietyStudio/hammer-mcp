 * The distinction `run_pack auto` is built on.
 *
 * A dependency found inside a VPK is base game content: every player who owns the game has
 * it. One found as a **loose file** in the content tree is almost always the mapper's own
 * work in progress -- it resolves at home because it is on that disk, and it is a
 * checkerboard for everyone else. The two are indistinguishable until you ask which
 * filesystem answered, and getting it wrong either wastes megabytes or ships a broken map.
 *
 * Tested by pointing the same map at two different game trees: one real, one a temporary
 * tree holding a loose copy of the material the probe uses.

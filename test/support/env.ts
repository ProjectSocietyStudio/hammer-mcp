/**
 * What the machine running the tests actually has.
 *
 * Most of this suite is not a unit test: it drives the real Source toolchain under wine,
 * the real Python sidecar, and real maps. None of that ships with the repo, so nearly
 * every file guarded itself with its own `existsSync` against its own hand-built path.
 * Six of them also computed the repo root as `test/fixtures/../../..` -- three levels up,
 * which lands OUTSIDE this repository and only resolves to anything meaningful when the
 * checkout happens to sit inside the private workspace it was written in.
 *
 * One place decides all of it now, and `HAMMER_MCP_REPO` overrides the guess, so a
 * contributor with a different layout points the suite at their tree instead of editing
 * six files.
 *
 * The other half of the job is being loud. A skipped test and a passing test look the
 * same in a green summary, and a contributor who runs `pnpm test` on a bare machine
 * deserves to know that the compiler tests never ran rather than to conclude the
 * toolchain works. `announceMissing()` says what is absent, once per process.

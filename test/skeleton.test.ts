/**
 * Creating a map, which nothing here could do until now.
 *
 * The gap was found by trying to use this toolkit for its stated purpose: an agent building
 * a map with these tools and nothing else got `ENOENT` from `write_vmf_solid` on the very
 * first call, enumerated all sixty-nine tools, found none that creates a `.vmf`, and had to
 * write a skeleton by hand -- breaking the one rule the exercise was built around.
 *
 * The suite had quietly paid the same cost: `test/build.test.ts` carries a hand-written
 * `SKELETON` constant for exactly this reason.
 *
 * The last test here is the one that matters. Two programs written on the same afternoon
 * agreeing proves less than it looks, so a map created by `write_vmf`, filled by
 * `write_vmf_solid` and by nothing else, is handed to vbsp -- and must seal.

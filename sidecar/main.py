"""Sidecar for the Source file formats srctools already knows how to read.

One subprocess per call: a verb in argv[1], a JSON request on stdin, a JSON reply on
stdout, diagnostics on stderr. No daemon and no lock -- that is the point. hammer-mcp is
stateless, and the incident that produced gmod-mcp's daemon.lock is exactly what a
long-lived helper here would invite.

The boundary follows call frequency, not file format: what is hot and already proven
stays in TypeScript (BSP by offset, KeyValues with offsets preserved, the .lmp codec);
what is cold and expensive to rewrite lives here.

Every reply is a JSON object. Failures come back as {"error": {...}} with exit code 1,
never as a traceback on stdout: the caller parses this, and a half-JSON stream would
look like a protocol fault rather than a bad path.

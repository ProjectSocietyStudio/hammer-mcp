"""Loading the game's own FGD, which is the schema every VMF is checked against.

The FGD is what Hammer itself enforces: which keyvalues a class accepts, which inputs it
answers to, which outputs it can fire. Checking a VMF against it catches, before a
40-minute compile, the class of mistake that otherwise only shows up as an entity that
silently does nothing in game.

`garrysmod.fgd` from the GMod install is used rather than srctools' bundled multi-game
database. The bundle is broader and wronger for us: its `prop_dynamic` unions 111
keyvalues across every Source game, where GMod's own says 39. It also has no
`sent_ball`, and a lint that does not know a class exists reports it as unknown.

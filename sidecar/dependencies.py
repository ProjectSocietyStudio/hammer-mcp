"""What a compiled map actually references, and whether any of it will be missing.

The failure this exists to catch is the only one on the list a mapper never sees at home:
the purple checkerboard. It has the assets, so its map looks right on its own machine and
wrong on everyone else's. `run_pack` has always needed an explicit list of files, which
means the check for "did I forget one" was a human reading two lists side by side.

## Why the walk is recursive, and why that is the whole difficulty

Resolving one level -- material to texture -- produces a short, plausible, wrong list. A
`.vmt` can be a `patch` over another `.vmt`, water carries `$bottommaterial`, a broken
shader falls back through `$fallbackmaterial`, and a model names materials this map's
texture table never mentions. Each of those is a second hop, and a resolver that stops at
the first reports success while the map ships broken.

srctools does the two hard parts: `Material.apply_patches` follows `patch`/`include`
chains, and `Model.iter_textures` reads a `.mdl`'s own material list.

## What "missing" means here, precisely

Three answers, and the distinction matters more than the counts:

  packed   -- inside the map's own pakfile, lump 40. Ships with the map.
  game     -- found in the game's mounted content: its VPKs and loose files.
  missing  -- neither. This is the checkerboard.

An asset resolved as `game` ships only if the player owns and has mounted that game. A
Counter-Strike texture resolves fine on a machine with CS:S mounted and is a checkerboard
on one without, so the tool reports which filesystem answered rather than folding both
into "fine".

"""Searching the game's own content: which materials and models exist, and what they are.

A mapper picks a texture from Hammer's browser and a prop from its model viewer. An agent
had neither, so it named materials from memory -- and vbsp resolves a name literally, which
makes a wrong one a purple checkerboard nobody sees until a player loads the map. `set_face_
material` can now change a wall's material; this is how you find out what to change it to.

The mounting is the same one `dependencies.py` uses, deliberately: `Game(dir).get_filesystem()`
chains the VPKs and the loose tree in the order the engine reads them. Reusing it means the
answer here and the answer there cannot disagree about what is installed.

Two things this does not do, and says so rather than implying otherwise:

**It does not judge whether a texture looks right.** It reports the shader, the flags and the
size; "is this the brick for a 1970s Bronx tenement" is not a measurement.

**It does not read every VMT to answer a search.** A Garry's Mod install holds tens of
thousands, and parsing them all to answer "brick" would cost seconds per call. The search is
over names; `details` reads the VMTs of what the search returned, which is a handful.

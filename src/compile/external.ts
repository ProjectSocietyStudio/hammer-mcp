/**
 * Driving a standalone Windows tool that is not part of a game install.
 *
 * The compilers come with the game and are found by discovery. These do not: they are
 * separate downloads from ficool2's tools page, they belong to no Steam library, and a
 * machine that has never heard of them is the normal case. So the whole file is built
 * around one rule -- **an absent tool is a reported state, never a crash** -- and around
 * a second one that the compilers never needed.
 *
 * ## Console tools here are interactive, and that is not an obstacle
 *
 * `bsp_rename.exe` prints `Enter the bsp name:` and waits. Written for a person dragging a
 * file onto it, which is exactly the shape an agent cannot use -- unless the answers are
 * fed on stdin, which is what `stdin` below is for. Measured 14/08/2026: three lines (the
 * path, the new name, and a newline for its "press any key") drive it to completion under
 * wine with no terminal at all.
 *
 * The `Press any key to continue...` at the end is why every call needs a timeout it can
 * survive: a tool waiting on a key it will never get looks identical to a slow one.

/**
 * Whether a skyname names a sky the configured game actually ships.
 *
 * `write_vmf` picks `sky_day01_01` by default -- Source's own -- and on the install this
 * repository is developed against, vbsp answers every compile with two `*** Error:` lines
 * about it: the vtf files "weren't compiled with the same size texture and/or same flags",
 * so it cannot build a default cubemap. Harmless, graded `info` by `read_compile_log`, fixed
 * by `buildcubemaps` in game -- and three separate builders have now spent a moment reading
 * those two lines before concluding they did not matter (issue #62).
 *
 * The tool that *chose* the value is the one that could have checked it. This is that check.
 *
 * ## What it proves, and what it does not
 *
 * It proves the six sides exist, by mounting the same VPK-and-loose chain the engine reads
 * through. It does **not** prove they will build a cubemap: that is a statement about the
 * `.vtf` headers -- dimensions and flags across the six faces -- which nothing in this server
 * reads today. So a sky can pass here and still produce those two lines, and the note says so
 * rather than implying a guarantee it has not earned.
